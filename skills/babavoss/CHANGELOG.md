# Changelog

What each version of babavoss changed, newest first. The framework ships inside it, as `framework/`, at the same version. Versions follow semantic versioning and are set by hand, in `package.json`, in the commit that makes the change.

## 0.2.0

- A build tab is open from the start. The agent writes the app's brief there before any code, asks what only the person can decide, and waits for the person to approve the brief on the page. The app is then made from the template with one action, and its page runs before the first step is built.
- A project's own apps live in `skills/NAME`. Build makes a new app there and installs it in the project by links from `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`.
- The template is a shell app of one util that is always open. Its page shows the surface and offers one decision; it has no form.
- In a shell, the agent is told at `/` what changes in any tab, paths named under `at` are given whole, and a util can be always open.
- An action can be declared an ask, offered to the person only.
- agent-config is now promptware: a list of the description, SKILL.md, the open answer and the references, in the order they reach the agent, with the one in view rendered beside it.
- A running app loads a change in its code in place: the process, its address and the person's open page stay, and code that does not load leaves the code before it running. An open page loads again by itself when the page's own code changes.
- A runtime that was asleep wakes at the address its session last had.
- A shell page has one stylesheet, the app's; the build says so when it is missing.
- The authoring app lists a folder as an app only where it has both SKILL.md and scripts/open.ts.
- An app that still holds the 0.1.0 framework runs as before: it ends when its code changes and is woken by the next call. To take the new behaviour, replace its `framework/` with this version's and adapt the app, as the start reference says. In a shell app, what a wrapper did to sum up tabs at `/`, give paths whole or open a util at the start, the shell now does.
